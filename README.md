# 06-weather-dashboard

A weather dashboard using the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data.

This pulls date, forecast, and an icon representation of weather conditions, as well as temperature, wind speed and humidity.

This dashboard also allows for search, with the actual coordinates replacing the city name.
